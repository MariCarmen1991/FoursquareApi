# FoursquareApi - Search Places Application
*Developing an app is always challenging and facing unexpected problems. This application has been developed in just four days, as a code challenge proposal. During the duration of the project I have encountered some difficulties that I have been solving along the way.
Some of the challenges and difficulties have been: investigate and know the response of the webService, manage nulls, have the data in the different fragments and try to use a clear architecture and clean code.
With more time and more research, I'm sure this app can be improved. However, I am proud of the work done and the end result.*


# About
Simple application that allows you to search for places around a place. This application uses the  **API places Foursquare** to obtain the information of the places.
On the other hand, it allows you to search for places using the Google Api Places Autocomplete resource. <br>
<b>Important: if you want to use this resource you must have a valid API KEY from google. 
  Google Autocomplete won't work if you don't enter a payment method in your Google account.</b>
